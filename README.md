# Realtime Radio Station iOS App

This application allows a user to DJ a radio station or listen to one that has been created. It uses PubNub's global data stream network to make this a realtime app.

Searching for tracks to add to a playlist is handled through the iTunes Search API, then those tracks are played using the Apple Music API. This app has been written for a tutorial, https://www.pubnub.com/blog/2016-07-06-realtime-radio-station-application-using-apple-music-and-itunes-search-apis/?preview=true.
